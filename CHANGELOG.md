  because we don't use them elsewhere and complicates the `PlatformNames`
  with `everywhere` and `undefined`.
    
* Removed `PlatformNames.everywhere` and `PlatformNames.undefined`, because
  we don't print these anywhere except in tests.

* Removed `PlatformNames.dartExtension`, because we use it only internally.

* Removed `DartPlatform.restrictedTo`, using the fields `components` and `uses` instead.

* Removed `PlatformNames.server` (and its platform detection), using a wider `other` platform instead.

  as it has not worked out in practice. Instead, we've added a `--hosted-url`
  command line argument.

## 0.8.0

* `PackageAnalyzer.inspectPackage` added a named argument 
  `deleteTemporaryDirectory`. Setting this to `false` retains the
  directory and prints its location to the log. Useful for debugging.

* `Maintenance`
  * **BREAKING** `getMaintenanceScore` now takes an optional `age` parameter 
    replacing the previously required `publishDate` parameter.

  * Changed the meaning of version fields:
    * `isExperimentalVersion` now means pre-V1.
    * `isPreReleaseVersion` now means there is a pre-release flag
      like `-beta`, `-alpha`, etc.
  
  * **BREAKING** maintenance-related `Suggestion` entries as moved to `Maintenance.suggestions`

* **BREAKING** `Suggestion.file` is now `String` instead of `dynamic`.

## 0.7.0+1

* Fixed issue where analyzer and/or formatter were run on directories with no
  Dart files.

## 0.7.0

* **Breaking changes**

  * `Summary.sdkVersion` is now a `Version` instead of `String`.

    a `String`.

    * Renamed `error` to `description`

  * Refactored `Fitness`:
