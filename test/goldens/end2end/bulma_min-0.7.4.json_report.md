## 0/50 Pass static analysis

### [x] 0/50 points: code has no errors, warnings, lints, or formatting issues

* Running `dart pub outdated` failed with the following output:

```
The lower bound of "sdk: '>=1.0.0 <3.0.0'" must be 2.12.0'
or higher to enable null safety.
```


## 0/40 Support up-to-date dependencies

### [x] 0/10 points: All of the package dependencies are supported in the latest version

<details>
<summary>
Sdk constraint doesn't support current Dart version {{sdk-version}}. Cannot run `dart pub outdated`.
</summary>

`pubspec.yaml:8:8`

```
  ╷
8 │   sdk: '>=1.0.0 <3.0.0'
  │        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Try widening the upper boundary of the constraint.

### [x] 0/20 points: Compatible with dependency constraint lower bounds

`dart pub downgrade` failed with:

```
OUT:
Resolving dependencies...
ERR:
The lower bound of "sdk: '>=1.0.0 <3.0.0'" must be 2.12.0'
or higher to enable null safety.

The current Dart SDK (3.4.0) only supports null safety.

For details, see https://dart.dev/null-safety
```

Run `dart pub downgrade` and then `dart analyze` to reproduce the above problem.

You may run `dart pub upgrade --tighten` to update your dependency constraints, see [dart.dev/go/downgrade-testing](https://dart.dev/go/downgrade-testing) for details.
