Resolving dependencies...

pubspec.yaml has no lower-bound SDK constraint.

environment:
  sdk: '^3.9.0'

See https://dart.dev/go/sdk-constraint

Run `dart pub downgrade` and then `dart analyze` to reproduce the above problem.

You may run `dart pub upgrade --tighten` to update your dependency constraints, see [dart.dev/go/downgrade-testing](https://dart.dev/go/downgrade-testing) for details.
